            <h2>About Gibson</h2>
            <p>GGibson is an absolute lovebug, 2 y/o Husky/Bulldog/Beagle mix. He's an incredible adventure partner who loves hiking, camping, and exploring the outdoors while also being the ultimate snuggle buddy. He adores curling up near his people, or snoozing near them during the day. </p>
            <p>Gibson has plenty of energy and thrives with daily walks and playtime, but once his needs are met, he settles right down to be your loving shadow. He's good with kids and larger dogs, and truly happiest with a canine companion by his side (he's never been an only dog). </p>
          <p>He travels with us often and is a dream in the car. </p>
            <p>Gibson is ABSOLUTELY NOT a match for homes with cats or small dogs, and he needs a secure electric fence (he can scale a 6-foot fence with ease). </p>
            <p>He will need continued obedience training, and he learns quickly with consistency. </p>
            <p>We are completely heartbroken to rehome him, but a recent incident with one of our cats made it clear a feline-free home is the best fit for him.</p>
