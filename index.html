            <h2>About Gibson</h2>
            <p>Gibson is an absolute lovebug. He is just the sweetest dog. He's an incredible adventure partner who loves hiking, camping, and exploring the outdoors while also being the ultimate snuggle buddy during down time. He adores curling up near his people, or snoozing near them during the day. </p>
            <p>He has plenty of energy and thrives with daily walks and playtime, but once his needs are met, he settles right down to be your lap buddy. He's good with kids and larger dogs, and would be truly happiest with a canine companion by his side (he's never been an only dog). </p>
            <p>He travels with us often and is a dream in the car. </p>

            <h2>Gibson's History</h2>
            <p>Gibson was adopted from a local animal shelter in March. He came from an accidental litter of puppies and lived in a home with multiple other dogs. He never received any vet care or training prior to his adoption. He came with no house manners.</p>
            <p>Since his adoption, we have had Gibson neutered, fully vaccinated, and attended obedience training classes. is much, much better than he was, but he is still a work in progress. If you adopt him, he will venefit from continued obedience training, but he love to please you and learns quickly with consistency.</p>
            <p>Alert: He can ascale a 6 foot fence with ease, and we recently installed an electric fence which has worked well to comtain him safely in our yard.</p>

            <h2>Cats</h2>
            <p>Despite months of effort, we’ve had zero success introducing him to our cats. He becomes overexcited, whines, and chases them, and, sadly, just severely injured one when he managed to enter the room with them. Gibson is <b>ABSOLUTELY NOT</b> a match for homes with cats, small dogs or other small animals.</p>
            <p>We’re absolutely heartbroken, but believe that rehoming him is the best thing for both him and the rest of our 4-legged family.</p>
