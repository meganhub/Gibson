        <p>We are absolutely heartbroken, but we need to find a new home for Gibson as soon as possible. Despite months of trying, he is not safe with cats or small pets, so we’re looking for a place where he can truly thrive. If you’re looking for a sweet, loyal companion to join you on runs, hikes, camping trips, or travels — Gibson is your guy. He loves being active and outdoors, but at the end of the day, he’s just as happy to curl up beside you, melt right into you, and soak up all the love and snuggles.</p>

            <p>Gibson is an absolute lovebug. He is just the sweetest dog. He's an incredible adventure partner who loves hiking, camping, and exploring the outdoors while also being the ultimate snuggle buddy during down time. He adores curling up near his people, or snoozing near them during the day. </p>
            <p>He has plenty of energy and thrives with daily walks and playtime, but once his needs are met, he settles right down to be your lap buddy. He's good with kids and dogs his size or larger, and, while he's never been an only dog, would do well as a single pup if provided with plenty of affection from his human pack. </p>
            <p>Gibson has plenty of experience traveling and is a dream in the car - he settles right down and goes to sleep. </p>

            <tr><td>
            <p>Gibson was adopted from a local animal shelter in March. He came from an accidental (?) litter of puppies and lived in a home with multiple other dogs. He never received any vet care or training prior to his adoption and came to us with no house manners.</p>
            <p>Since adopting Gibson, we’ve had him neutered, fully vaccinated, and enrolled him in obedience training classes. While Gibson is still polishing his manners, he has come a long way and thrives with consistency. He loves to please and learns quickly, and with continued training he’s sure to mature into the perfect companion.</p>
            <p>Because Gibson is so athletic, he has shown he can clear a 6-foot fence, so a secure setup is important. An electric fence has worked very well to safely keep him in our yard, and he’ll thrive with adopters who can offer him a fenced yard with a safe space to play.</p>

Gibson is <b>ABSOLUTELY NOT</b> a match for homes with cats, small dogs or other small animals.</p>
            <p>We’re absolutely heartbroken, but believe that rehoming him is the best thing for both him and the rest of our 4-legged family.</p>
